What is python ??
python is high level programming language, used in web development, AI and ML.Easy to understand and readable.
--> High level means Easy to understand for humans.
--> Low Level means Closer to Machine Hardware ex.Machine Language and Assembly Language.

What are the data types in python??
Premitive -> int str bool etc..
Derived -> List ,Tupple etc..

List -> 'Ordered' 'Mutable' 'Duplicate allows' 'str int can used.'
Tupple -> 'Ordered' ''Immutable' 'Duplicate allows' 'mix data types like above.' 
Set -> 'UnOrdered' 'Mutable' 'Duplicate does not allow' ** Important for methamatics calculations..
Dictionary -> 'UnOrdered untill python 3.6 ' 'Mutable' 'Unique keys' 'Values can be of any  data types'

Key Features of Python -> Simple syntax , interpreted language(code will execute line by line and do not need 
compiler like java) , Dynamically types language and OOps..

--> Python uses Garbage Collection to manage memory..
NameSpace -> Its like a container which holds name (Identifiers) and their respective values or like a dict..

How do you define a function in python ?
def add(a,b):
return a+b

List Comprehensions -> I want to excute a loop from 0 to 9 and want to write my code in single line or 
concise way
numbers_list = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(numbers_list)

Decorator -> Decorator is the functions that modifies behaviours of another function.

Self --> It refers to the current instance of the class and used to access variables of a class..

Generators --> It is a special type of function that returns one value at a time with yield keyword to save memory.

args --> Positional arguments 
kwargs --> keyword arguments like context = mycontext

Shallow copy --> It is affected when we update our list..
Deep copy --> It is not affected because recursively copies all nested objects..

Exceptions in python --> try and except keywords..
try:
 number/0
except ZeroDivisionError:
 print('Cannot divide by zero') 

MetaClass --> Its a class that creates classes.class is an instance of a MetaClass..

GIL --> Global interpreter lock (It allows to execute one thread at a time..)

MonkeyPatching --> We have to change behaviour of a cllss with changing its original code..

Python2 --> We do not use paranthesis with print function and return integer after divison..
Python3 --> We use paranthesis with print function and return true fraction after divison..

Integer Mwemory --> GC(Grabage Collector) from -5 to 256 same memory but outside range different address..
String Memory --> GC(Garbage Collector) s1 =  hello and s2 = hello both are same meory but ''.join(['h','e','l','l','o'])
it will have different memory in heap..

Instance method --> takes self as an argument and works like a regular function..
Static method --> It does not take nither self nor cls , access from class Name..
Classmethod --> takes cls as an argument and can be accessed only class level data..


--> __init__ initializes an instance of a class while __new__ creates new instance..

--> len() is a function to find out length while __len__() is a special method in class 
which allows to work with len()..


--> List Slicing
list[start:stop:step]
Baisc list_11 = [10,20,30,40,50.60,70]
** print(list_11[1:4]) # 20 30 40

** print(list_11[:4]) # 10 20 30 40

** print(list_11[3:]) # 40 50 60 70

** print(list_11[::2]) # 10 30 50 70

** print(list_11[1:6:2]) # 20 40 60

--> Negative Index 
** print(list_11[-3:]) # 50 60 70

** print(list_11[:-3])

*** Reverse a list --> print(list_11[::-1]) # 70 60 50 40 30 20 10..

Strings are Immutable in nature in python
text = 'hello'
text[0] = 'j' TypeError

How to achieve it
text = 'j'+text[1:]
Now it becomes jello..
